# Deployment

## Local Docker deployment

Follow the root README. Docker named volumes persist the SQLite database, tenant workspaces, Codex login/thread state, and the seeded Codex CLI runtime.

Useful checks:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=200 app
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:37821/codex-web/api/health
```

Back up all three named volumes before upgrades. Keep `.env` outside source control.

## Reverse proxy

Terminate TLS at your reverse proxy and forward `/codex-web/` to `http://127.0.0.1:37821/codex-web/`. Preserve the path prefix, pass the original host and protocol headers, disable response buffering for event streams, and use a long read timeout for active tasks.

Set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to the final HTTPS URL. Do not publish container port 37821 directly to the internet.

## Updating

```bash
git pull --ff-only
docker compose up -d --build
```

The container seeds a newer bundled Codex CLI into the persistent runtime volume on startup. Existing login and thread state remain in the tenant volume.
